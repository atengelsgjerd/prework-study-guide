# A Bootcamp Student's Prework Study Guide

## Description

This study guide was created for students entering a coding bootcamp with hands on guidance on creating a webpage using HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. By creating a webpage that is a study guide on the topics used to create the webpage, not only are students getting hands on education and experience, but they are creating their own study guide they can use throughout the course they are about to begin.

## Usage

This webpage is used for coding bootcamp students to refer to when studying the different topics of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript throughout their classes. Also, by opening up the DevTools console (right click on the webpage and click on "inspect" from the dropdown menu that pops up, then navigate to the tab that says "Console"), we can  see the JavaScript running. It lists the topics covered on the guide, and each time the page is refreshed, it will choose a different topic to study first.
