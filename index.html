        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The three ways to style a webpage using CSS are: inline CSS, internal CSS stylesheet, and external CSS stylesheet</li>
          <li>Inline CSS is used when wanting to style an element directly in the HTML file</li>
          <li>Inline CSS is useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets</li>
          <li>Most common way to style a webpage is by using external CSS style sheet</li>
          <li>When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a link element placed in the HTML's head</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply</li>
          <li>The margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
          <li>The padding property adds space around the content inside an element</li>
          <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained</li>
          <li>If the display property is assigned with the block value, it assigns each selector to start on a new line</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector</li>
          <li>The period preceding .card designates this as a class selector. Any HTML element assigned to the class "card" will gain these property assignments from the CSS</li>

        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout - b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>git add -A stages the changes</li>
          <li>git commit -m is used in the command line to commit your changes on github.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>The const keyword allows us to create variables that can't be reassigned a value.</li>
          <li>We use an assignment operator (=) to assign the specific data that we want stored in our variable</li>
          <li>When using the "if" statement, code will only execute if the statement meets a condition, or is true.</li>
          <li>The strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a Boolean result (true) if the values are equal and (false) if the values are not equal.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data.</li>
          <li>An array can store different types of data, such as strings, numbers, etc.</li>
          <li>An index is a unique number given to a data item within an array.</li>
          <li>A "for" loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li>The "let" keyword allows us to reassign the value of a variable over time.</li>
          <li>A function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
          <li>To declare a function, we use the "function" keyword and then give our function a unique name followed by parentheses. Then we add curly brackets {} that contain the code for the task we want to perform.</li>
